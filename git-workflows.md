# Git Workflows
Choosing the right Git workflow is a very important step for any (computational) project.
But each and every project starts small...

## Single-User Workflows
When you start a project, you're the only person contributing to it, so you know exactly what you're going to do.
So, there is no apparent reason to use anything other than an eternal loop of three steps:

1. Make a change
2. Stage it
3. Commit

### Pros
+ Unlimited "undo"

### Cons
- No backups

### TODO

- Add a 'saw blade' change-add-commit image
